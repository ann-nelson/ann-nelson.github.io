            <p>Embroidery is a way of transforming fabric into a piece of art with just a needle and some thread. </p>
            <p>It involves stitching designs onto cloth, often using colorful threads, beads, or sequins. It has been used to personalize clothes, create art, or 
                add decoration to things like pillows, tablecloths, and so many things.</p>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am not exactly sure how embroidery first came into the world, other than as a way to create beautiful designs on clothing, tapestries, and countless other items. </p>
            <p>But for my family, embroidery became a tradition in 1981 when my eldest sibling was born. My parents embroidered Christmas stockings for my sibling and themselves, 
                starting a tradition of making a stocking for every new family member as a way to welcome them. </p>
            <p>Everyone played a part in the process, from separating the thread to stitching the designs and assembling the final pieces.</p>

            <h2>Best Times</h2>
            <p>Embroidery is a fantastic activity to enjoy year-round. It's a great activity to do when stuck indoors because of bad weather or whatever reason. 
                It is a cozy and quiet hobby to relax with, as it lets you concentrate on making beautiful designs while staying comfortable inside.</p>

            <h2>Locations</h2>
            <p>The best thing about this hobby is its flexibility—you can do it anywhere! 
                I have done it in cars, on trains, at home, and even during downtime at work 
                (no judgment, it is definitely more productive than mindlessly scrolling through Instagram or rewatching the 
                same show for the tenth time).</p>
            <p>Another great thing about this hobby is that supplies are easy to find—you can get them at specialty stores, 
                craft shops, or even good old Walmart.</p>

            <h3>Buy a Kit</h3>
            <p>I do kits since it provides everything that I will need to complete the craft. 
                So don't have to decide on the thread color, the stich you are going to use, and so on.</p>

            <h2>Why This</h2>
            <p>During the winter season, my parents would get the whole family involved in embroidery. 
                I do this hobby because it is a calm, creative, and peaceful way to spend my free time. We currently have a stocking in progress for a new family addition, 
                Ringo Star, my mom is cat. 
                For me, embroidery is a way to unwind, disconnect from the world, and give my mind a break.</p>
