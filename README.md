Course: ITIS 3135 - Web Application Design and Developement

Term: Spring 2025

Coursework 
Tasked with creating a variety of websites, ranging from academic to client-based and personal pages. 
The websites were developed using various programming languages, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and utilizing platforms such as 
GitHub, Visual Studio Code, Cisco Secure, and FileZilla.

Webpages Overview
(The webpages listed below are listed in the order which they were designed and developed.) 
      
> ann-nelson.github.io:
		This was the first webpage we created during the course, serving as a personal webpage for each of us.
      
> itis3135:
		This academic webpage served as a navigation hub for all the platforms we would use during the course.
		It also featured an introductory section where we presented ourselves to our professor, teaching assistants, and classmates.
		Additionally, we created a contract page within the site acknowledging the expectations of the course.
      
> nelson-inc.com:
		For this professional webpage, each student created their own web design firm. We were required to find an available
    domain name containing our last name (e.g., nelson-inc.com).
      
> ambitiousdragon:
		This was a client-based webpage where we created an organization based on our class nickname.
    My organization, "Ambitious Dragon," is an art gallery that showcases and sells bold, innovative art.
        
> crappy:
		In this project, we were given the opportunity to design and develop a webpage without adhering to best practices.
		The goal was to demonstrate our understanding of what is considered poor design and development practices,
		as well as to use it as a reference for what to avoid in future projects.
