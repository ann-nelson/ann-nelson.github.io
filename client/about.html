        <p>Hello! I'm Amber Nelson, an artist based in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA. 
            My work explores themes of memory, identity, and the natural world through vibrant colors and expressive forms. 
            I studied art during my K-12 education and also was self taught, and over the years, Iâ€™ve exhibited my work at NC State Fair and peoples homes.</p>
