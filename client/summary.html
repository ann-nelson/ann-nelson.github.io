            <h2>Specifications</h2>
                <p>My website meets all the assignment requirements. I used the same header and footer component files on every page, keeping things consistent. The home page is named index.html and includes a proper 
                    layout with header, main, footer, IDs, classes, real content, images, and a working navigation bar. The navigation bar is the same on all pages and links to every section of the site. I also created 
                    four other pages with meaningful names and content that fit the website’s purpose. My footer includes a reference to me as the designer. The code is clean, with clear names, good indentation, helpful comments, 
                    and an organized layout.</p>

                <p>My website includes several interactive JavaScript features to engage users. First, I implemented automatic slideshows on the Home, Gallery, and Feedback pages, which change images every 5 seconds.
                    These slideshows also include pause and play buttons so users can focus on a specific image. On the Home and Feedback pages, the slideshow images have a hover feature that reveals a button linking
                    to the Gallery page. Another interactive feature is a rotating slogan below the header, which updates with a new slogan every 2 seconds. Lastly, the Contact page includes a form that displays error 
                    messages if required fields are left empty, and shows a confirmation message upon successful submission.</p>

                <p>My website follows the CRAP design principles in several ways. Contrast is shown by using different colors for backgrounds and text to make content easier to read. Repetition is used with consistent 
                    fonts, colors, and layout styles across all pages to create a unified look. Alignment keeps everything neat and organized by lining up text, images, and other elements. Proximity helps group related 
                    items together, like form fields and navigation links, so the site is easier to understand and use.</p>

        <section id="feedback">
            <h2>Feedback</h2>
                <p>Based on peer feedback from <a href="https://webpages.charlotte.edu/cearnha8/itis3135/review1.html">Caleb Earnhardt</a> and <a href="https://webpages.charlotte.edu/ethen/itis3135/review1.html">Erin Then</a>, 
                    my website was generally well-received but needed a few improvements. The first suggestion was to enhance contrast—particularly between 
                    the navigation and header, as well as between section backgrounds and text. To address this, I changed the header’s background color to distinguish it more clearly from the navigation bar and 
                    adjusted font colors across sections for better readability. Another piece of feedback pointed out that some text was too small, so I increased font sizes across all pages where appropriate. 
                    It was also noted that the feedback page’s background and font colors were inconsistent with the rest of the site, so I updated that page to align with the overall design. Lastly, 
                    I was advised to narrow the contact form and center it on the page. I made those changes but opted not to center the content within the form, as I felt it would detract from the visual 
                    balance and contradict key design principles regarding centering.</p>

        <section id="reflect">
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                I believe my website effectively meets the needs of my stakeholders by offering a clean, organized, and visually appealing platform to showcase their work, including drawings, paintings, 
                and physical builds. Features like slideshows, galleries, and interactive elements present their art in an engaging way, while the consistent layout and easy navigation enhance user experience. 
                In the future, I plan to add more interactive features, such as before-and-after project views and a form option that allows users to receive a copy of their submission. I also aim to improve the site’s 
                accessibility, performance, and overall aesthetics to create a better experience for all users. Since this site also reflects my growth as a beginner in web design, I will continue refining it as my skills develop.
